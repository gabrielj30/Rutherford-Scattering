## Objective  
The goal of this lab was to experimentally validate the Rutherford Scattering formula by measuring the count rate of alpha particles as a function of the scattering angle, aiming for minimal error.  

---

## Theory  
The experiment is based on Rutherford’s model, which describes the scattering of charged particles by a positively charged nucleus. The differential scattering cross-section formula used is:

\[
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{(Ze^2 z^2 e^4)}{16 E^2 \sin^4(\theta/2)}
\]

Where:  
- \(Z\) = nuclear charge  
- \(z\) = charge of the scattered particle  
- \(E\) = energy of the scattered particle  
- \(\theta\) = scattering angle

## Procedure  
1. **Setup:**  
   - The apparatus was pre-assembled due to the use of radioactive materials.  
   - The amplifier, discriminator, and oscilloscope were properly connected and turned on.  

2. **Calibration:**  
   - The detector’s operation was verified by removing the central plug and observing the high count rate.  
   - The discriminator was fine-tuned to reduce noise.  

3. **Data Collection:**  
   - The vacuum pump was activated slowly to avoid damaging the apparatus.  
   - Measurements were taken by adjusting the metal rod to vary the scattering angle.  
   - Calipers were used to record the distances accurately.  
   - Data was recorded at different scattering angles.

## Data & Calculations  
- **Scattering angles:**  
  - \( \theta_2 = 31.4^\circ \)  
  - \( \theta_1 = 19.1^\circ \)  
  - \( \theta = 50.5^\circ \)  
- **Cross-section calculation:**  
  - \( G = 5.58 \times 10^{-7} \)  
- **Particle count:**  
  - \( N_0 = 2.47 \times 10^7 \)  

---

## Error Analysis  
- The primary source of error was from the discriminator threshold calibration.  
- Lowering the threshold too much introduced noise and unreliable data.  
- Length measurement inaccuracies (~±1 cm) contributed to a maximum error of around 11%.  

---

## Conclusion  
The experimental results closely matched the predictions of the Rutherford model, confirming the presence of atomic nuclei. The Plum Pudding Model was invalidated by the observed scattering patterns, as it could not explain the large-angle deflections.
